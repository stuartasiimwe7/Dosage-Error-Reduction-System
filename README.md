Medications are lifesaving for patients, but misuse can lead to adverse effects. When treating patients, doctors and pharmacists make mistakes with dosages all the time. When the body is introduced to a new medication, there are usually a period of side effects. Doctors can help their patients adjust to their medications with minimal side effects by reducing errors in dosage.

In understanding dosage reductions, itâ€™s important to understand what these are. At its most basic level, a dose-error reduction software/system (DERS) when loaded on to the intended site(for example - infusion pumps), incorporates a drug library with predefined upper and lower drug dose limits (and infusion rates - for case of infusion pumps) which can reduce errors that may  conceived during administration of a particular drug/medicine.

There are numerous merits to this kind of software if in the hands of the people; Reductions in dosage errors should increase over time as people gain more experience with their medications. People can start budgeting their medications by understanding when each category requires a reduction in dosage. This includes learning when to reduce painkillers such as aspirin or beta blockers for high blood pressure treatment. Doing so will help you avoid accidental overdoses that could prove fatal and cause permanent damage to your body and mind alike.
